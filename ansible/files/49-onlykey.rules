# This file must be placed at:
#
# /etc/udev/rules.d/49-onlykey.rules    (preferred location)

#
# To install, type this command in a terminal:

ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="60fc", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="60fc", ENV{MTP_NO_PROBE}="1"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="60fc", MODE:="0666"
KERNEL=="ttyACM*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="60fc", MODE:="0666"
#
# If you share your linux system with other users, or just don't like the
# idea of write permission for everybody, you can replace MODE:="0666" with
# OWNER:="yourusername" to create the device owned by you, or with
# GROUP:="somegroupname" and mange access using standard unix groups.
#
# One requirement of TOTP (Time-based One-time Password) is having the correct
# time. If OnlyKey is used on a system where the OnlyKey app is not running it
# will display “NOTSET” instead of the OTP code. Because OnlyKey has no battery
# it requires an app to send it the correct time to be able to generate TOTP
# codes. If you have OnlyKey command-line utility installed, adding the
# following will automatically set the current time on OnlyKey every time you
# plug it: RUN+="/usr/local/bin/onlykey-cli settime"
#
# SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="60fc", MODE:="0660", GROUP:="onlykey", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/onlykey-cli settime"
# KERNEL=="ttyACM*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="60fc", MODE:="0660", GROUP:="onlykey", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/onlykey-cli settime"
